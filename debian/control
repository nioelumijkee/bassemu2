Description: a Pd object for transistor bass emulation
 bassemu~ is an object that simulates a transistor-based electronic
 synthesizer. This serves as a emulation of an analogue bass synth. It
 includes the obligatory filter, saw/rect/tri/sine waveform select, an
 extra hi-pass filter. You can also feed another signal to its left
 inlet, and filter that, either alone or mixed to the vco.
 .
 Also included is a small, messy gop abstraction to resemble a 16-step 
 sequencer.
